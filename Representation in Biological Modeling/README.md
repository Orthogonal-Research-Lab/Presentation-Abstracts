In recent years, technology has provided us with both massive increases in quantitative biological data along with computational technologies that can produce precise measurements of processes associated with these measurements. Yet the biology from which these data rise are still quite complex. Given this conundrum, a question arises: is there a systematic way to model only the most salient mechanisms in a complex biological process? Indeed, we can use the concept of representation to guide our ability to characterize highly-complex biological systems in an informative manner. Far from encouraging bias, representationalism relies upon only the elements predicted to be important in terms of potential theoretical models or prior experimental results. A particularly important enabling concept is model abstraction, or the practice of removing all non-essential elements of the biological system. In this talk, serveral examples of model abstraction will be presented for biological systems, from structures used in neural computing to mapping biological processes to computational data structures.
