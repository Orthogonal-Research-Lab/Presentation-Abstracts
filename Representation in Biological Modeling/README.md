Despite the massive recent increase in biological data, the biology from which these data rise is still quite complex. Given this conundrum, a question arises: is there a systematic way to model only the most salient mechanisms in a complex biological process? Indeed, we can use the concept of representation to guide our ability to characterize highly-complex biological systems in an informative manner. Far from encouraging bias, representationalism relies upon only the elements predicted to be important in terms of potential theoretical models or prior experimental results. A particularly important enabling concept is model abstraction, or the practice of removing all non-essential elements of the biological system. In this talk, serveral examples of model abstraction will be presented for biological systems, from neural networks/perceptrons to mapping biological processes to computational data structures.
