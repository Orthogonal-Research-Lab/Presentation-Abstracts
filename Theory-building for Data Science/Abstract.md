This talk makes an argument for the role of theory-building and theory more generally in interpreting the outcomes of data sets large and small. While there is a perpetual desire to eschew theory in favor of data, this talk will demonstrate that theory is essential for understanding large, complex datasets. We will draw on ideas from Psychophysics, Computer Science, and the Philosophy of Science to understand the concept of a mini-theory and its role in forming a basic theoretical unit. Then, we delve into more sophisticated concepts such as naive models, so-called _de navitus_ models, and topological approaches. The talk concludes with a discussion of meta-theories and how they are useful in bootstrapping expplanatory theories from data.
