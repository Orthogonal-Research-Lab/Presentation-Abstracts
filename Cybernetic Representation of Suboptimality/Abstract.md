## Cybernetic Representations of Suboptimal Regulatory Systems

### Abstract
In specific types of regulatory systems (e.g. gene expression), coherent function is directly related to optimal regulation. This often produces structures exhibiting a characteristic function (e.g. biological switches) or pattern of systemic behavior (e.g. mRNA aggregation). Yet such examples are also an artifact of scientific convenience, as complex biological systems more typically exhibit highly complicated, kluge-like, and suboptimal regulatory mechanisms. In this talk, we will revisit cybernetic theory and the assumption of functional optimality to situate this type of regulation in the context of biological variation and complexity. An analytical approach to suboptimality called the Cybernetic Convolutional Architecture (CCA) will exemplify the role of a proposed phenomenon called biological spaghettification in enabling regulatory robustness and evolutionary flexibility. Taking into account the Law of Requisite Variety, the Law of Open-Ended Evolution, and the Every Good Regulator Theorem, it will be shown how highly complex generic regulatory mechanisms emerge. Modeling the emergence of regulatory suboptimality is particularly useful in terms of understanding developmental systems, evolutionary origins, and chaotic dynamical behavior.
